## Description

This matches the structure of the original blob sketch from Week 2 but moves
details into classes.

The game controls a blob that can move side by side and jump up onto platforms. If the user finishes the level and reaches the end of the current map, the map will automatically advance to a more challenging level. The colours, number of platforms, and difficulty all change. There are three levels in total and the goal is for the user to make it past the third level, back to the first level.
